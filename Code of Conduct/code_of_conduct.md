3. Stick to the Agenda / Don't go off-topic

#### Jira

1. All team members make significant efforts at maintaining the Jira board.  Assigning tasks to individuals, moving them across the various columns to Done.  To adding any required new items into the backlog.

2. Ensure you have 1-2 tickets in Selected for Development at all times and one in the In Progress Column.

3. Move the tickets to Done when you finish it.

1. When code or assets are added to the team repository, I accept that that is now the teams property and can be used even if I leave the team.

2. Always PULL from the repository before making any changes
