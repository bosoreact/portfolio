### Reason For Meeting
- Show Karen (customer) Figma Wireframes for Mobile and Desktop apps.
- Receive feedback on Wireframes.
- Discuss timescales and what should be delivered at end of next sprint.

### Mobile Figma Wireframe Feedback
- Karen liked the look of the wireframe.
- Keep the rewards animation a lesser priority.
- 5th Button on Wireframe is blank.
- Make panels wider to create room for writing.
    - This will also create less black space around big panels.
- Keep meal planning, shopping list, etc on separate screens rather than one screen for all.
- Focus on meal planning as the main page and have other pages as modal layers rather than separate pages.

### Desktop Figma Wireframe Feedback
- Again, Karen liked look of wireframe.
- Ensure more emphasis is put on meal planne and shopping list inputs.  Also, progress charts and info.

### Developing App Discussion
- It was agreed that the desktop app would be developed first using React Native.
- The mobile app would then be developed from the desktop app, again using React Native.
- Existing APIs which link to food datasets could be used to add food and nutritional info to app.
